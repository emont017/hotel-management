    <h1>Hotel Management System</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
        This system was developed as part of our Senior Capstone Project for Florida International University’s College of Engineering & Computing. It provides core functionalities for administrators to manage room inventory, monitor bookings, and support day-to-day operations, inspired by enterprise-level tools such as Hilton’s OnQ platform.
